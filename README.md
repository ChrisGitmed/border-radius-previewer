# border-radius-previewer
A simple React app created to help understand how the border-radius property effects elements.

### What I learned
* How to copy things to users clipboard by using the .select() method on a React Ref, followed by document.execCommand('copy');
* The CSS property border-radius actually has 8 possible values, not just 4!
* How to create a polished background gradient with the CSS function linear-gradient().
